The results of a collaberative group project for my Intro to Software Eng. class. The objective was to redesign the donate and contact page's for a local charity here in Georgia, colleberating with a representative from the charity along the way so that we could meet their requirements. The final product was officialy presented by myself to the charity, where I went over the basic features and improvements over their previous design. The project was mostly focused on team building, so I was in charge of collecting information from the client, creating basic UI mockup for our coder to follow, and presenting the product to the client. The code itself is not written by me.
